# 6003 Assessment 2

* Time: 60 minutes
* Closed book
* Individual

There are 22 questions that cover these topics:

* ROC/Profit Curve
* Bagging
* Boosting
* K-Means/PAM
* Clustering Evaluation
* Expectation Maximization and GMM
* Proximity Clustering

Here is a review of those two weeks of the course to prepare for the skills test.

## ROC/Profit Curves

* Cost Benefit Matrix and Profit Curves: [notes](https://github.com/zipfian/DSCI6003-student/blob/master/week2/2.4/DSCI6003-2.4-Lecture.pdf)

## Bagging

* Properties of Bagging: [notes (Properties section)](https://github.com/zipfian/DSCI6003-student/blob/master/week5/DSCI6003-5.2-Lecture.ipynb#Properties)
